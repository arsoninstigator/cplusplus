# cpp projects / tiny games
each folder contains .cpp files that together make up simple games i made this summer while learning cpp from scratch. each folder contains one individual project (like rock paper scissors, snake game etc.) and each project folder has it's own readme with an explanation, a working demo link and/or a screenshot of the website or the output screen that's supposed to be viewable to the user.
