# terminal snake game
Snake is a classic game that includes a growing line represented as a snake that can consume items, change direction, and grow in length. As the snake grows larger in length, the difficulty of the game grows.

# rules to play
- don’t hit a wall and don’t bite your own tail ( since crashing into a wall or your tail will end the game immediately)
- 10 points will be added to the player’s score for eating the fruit. the player’s total score is calculated based on the number of fruits the snake consumed. the length of the snake will be increased after eating the fruits
- use w, a, s, d to move the snake.
